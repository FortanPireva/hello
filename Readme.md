# Macros
## Macros are expanded into Rust code during compilation, and can take a variable number of arguments. They are distinguished by a ! at the end. The Rust standard library includes an assortment of useful macros.

``` println!(format, ..)``` prints a line to standard output, applying formatting described in std::fmt.
```format!(format, ..)``` works just like println! but returns the result as a string.
```dbg!(expression)``` logs the value of the expression and returns it.
```todo!()``` marks a bit of code as not-yet-implemented. If executed, it will panic.
```unreachable!()``` marks a bit of code as unreachable. If executed, it will panic.

## Break and Contiue with Labels
```
fn main() {
    let s = [[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10], [21, 15, 32]];
    let mut elements_searched = 0;
    let target_value = 10;
    'outer: for i in 0..=2 {
        for j in 0..=2 {
            elements_searched += 1;
            if s[i][j] == target_value {
                break 'outer;
            }
        }
    }
    print!("elements searched: {elements_searched}");
}
```


## Arrays and Tuples
```
fn main() {
    let mut a: [i8; 10] = [42; 10];
    a[5] = 0;
    println!("a: {a:?}");
}
```

### Pattern Matching
Patterns and Destructuring
When working with tuples and other structured values itâ€™s common to want to extract the inner values into local variables. This can be done manually by directly accessing the inner values:

```
fn print_tuple(tuple: (i32, i32)) {
    let left = tuple.0;
    let right = tuple.1;
    println!("left: {left}, right: {right}");
}
```

However, Rust also supports using pattern matching to destructure a larger value into its constituent parts:
```
fn print_tuple(tuple: (i32, i32)) {
    let (left, right) = tuple;
    println!("left: {left}, right: {right}");
}
```
